This is a plugin for the `Babel` JavaScript transpiler that performs `JSX-to-JSX` transformations.\
It fits well with the BEM methodology.\
It's used by me in my own projects.

## How does it work?
It takes special `block`, `elem` and `mods` attributes and converts them to `className`.

## Purpose
I wanted to make writing classes easier, and this helps me with that.
