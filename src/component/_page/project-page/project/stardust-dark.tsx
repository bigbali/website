                A simple dark theme for VS Code tailored to my liking.
                It is published to the VS Code marketplace as well, and even has a single 5 star review ðŸ˜Š

            <p>
                It was made for JavaScript/TypeScript, but it's also doesn't look terrible with Rust and C#.
                I've made a Visual Studio extension as well. Feel free to ask me for the .vsix file if you care.
