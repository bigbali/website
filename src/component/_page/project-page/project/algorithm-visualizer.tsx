                    It is a Next.js application that aims to visualize the steps algorithms take when solving a problem.
                    It has various controls and is my most complex project to date.

                    I wanted to build some projects to showcase my skills, and what better project to show my understanding of
                    algorithm and data structures knowledge than an algorithm visualizer?
