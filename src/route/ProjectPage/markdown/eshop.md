This was my final project for Harvard Univesity's famous CS50 course.
It's an e-commerce application.

## How it's built
The backend is built with `Python` and `Flask` and I'm using `MySQL` for handling the data.
Generally, I would use an [ORM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping) when interacting with a database, but here we've got raw `SQL` queries.
Styles are done with `SASS` and `Bootstrap`.
