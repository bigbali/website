It's published to the Marketplace, so [click here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Starcrusher.stardust-dark){target="_blank"} if you want it.

## Why did you make this?
Because I wanted a theme I liked, I guess.

## How can I make one?
Simply. Check the theme's source code on GitHub, and you'll see it's really just pairing values in `JSON`.
