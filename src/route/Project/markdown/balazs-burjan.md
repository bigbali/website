This project is the one you are currently browsing.\
Its primary purpose is to expose myself and my work to the World Wide Web,
while the secondary is having fun while building it ðŸ˜ƒ\
It's an `SPA (Single Page Application)` hosted on Vercel's amazing hosting service.
## What's under the hood?
I built this project based on my very own
[React Template project](/project/react-template "Go to React Template project details"), which in turn is built with my very own [Babel Plugin](/project/babel-plugin "Go to Babel Plugin project details").

## What did I learn from it?
Well, there are a few new tricks I learned from this project:
- [Spline](https://spline.design/ "Go to Spline home page"), where I made the 3D landing animation.\
It definitely made it easier than having written it from scratch using `WebGL`, and easier even than using `Three.js`.\
However, it has one huge drawback: bundle size and general performance impact, even after optimizing every part that does not take away from the user experience.
- Scroll animations.
- Embedding `Markdown` in `React`. In fact, this was written in `Markdown`.
