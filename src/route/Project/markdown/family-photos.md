This project was built with 2 things in mind:
1. - provide an interface through which my family can check out my photos (primarily taken at family events)
2. - try `AWS`

As of now, this project is not mantained, but in the future I will certainly build one that's better.

## Technologies
- `Django`
- `AWS S3` - this is where I store all static content, such as images and style sheets
- The backend was hosted on `Heroku` while there were free tier dynos

## What can it do?
Well, it has collections that contain images, and a carousel which makes viewing them somewhat enjoyable.\
It also has a beautiful admin control panel, which is of course the part of the app that I use to administrate all the images.
