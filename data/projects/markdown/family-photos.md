This project was built with 2 things in mind:
1. - provide an interface through which my family can check out my photos taken at family events
2. - try `AWS`

As of now, this project is not mantained, but in the future I will certainly build one that's better.
It had a functional system for image collections and a nice admin page.

## Technologies
- `Django`
- `AWS S3` - this is where I store all static content, such as images and style sheets
- The backend was hosted on `Heroku` while they had free dynos (they don't any more)

## Why the heck do I see monkeys?
Rest assured, that's not my family, just some fellas I met in the zoo :)
