This project aims to ease the development of future projects while also serving as an experimentation platform.\
It has the configuration and a few common components and functionality that will significantly improve my future productivity.
## Technologies
- `TypeScript`
- `React` (`create-react-app`)
- `CRACO` (Create React App Configuration Override)
- `Redux`
- `SASS`
- [My own Babel plugin for JSX transformations](/project/babel-plugin "Go to Babel plugin project details page")

## The future of this project
I am planning to incorporate changes from [this](/project/balazs-burjan "Go to Home page"), which among others include
replacing `Redux` with `Zustand`, migrating from `CRA` to `Next`, adding a few components and some structural changes.
