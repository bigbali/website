This project is the one you are currently browsing.\
Its primary purpose is to expose myself and my work to the World Wide Web,
while the secondary is having fun while building it ðŸ˜ƒ\
It's an `SPA (Single Page Application)` hosted on Vercel's amazing hosting service.
## What's under the hood?
I built this project based on my very own
[React Template project](/project/react-template "Go to React Template project details"), which in turn is built with my very own [Babel Plugin](/project/babel-plugin "Go to Babel Plugin project details").

## What did I learn from it?
Well, there are a few new tricks I learned from this project:
- [Spline](https://spline.design/ "Go to Spline home page"), which I used to make the 3D landing animation (if you're on mobile, it's omitted to reduce package size and improve performance!).\
It definitely made it easier than having written it from scratch using plain `WebGL`or `Three.js`, however
it has one huge drawback: bundle size and general performance impact, even after optimizing every part I could.
- Scroll animations.
- Embedding `Markdown` in `React`. In fact, this was written in `Markdown`.

## What's next?
I intend to migrate the entire project from `CRA` to `Next.js` in parallel to my [React Template](/project/react-template "Go to React Template project details").\
This definitely is not the final form of this project, so feel free to open an issue on GitHub or send a message in case you've got a suggestion!
