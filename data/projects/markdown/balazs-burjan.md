This project is the one you are currently browsing.\
Its primary purpose is to expose myself and my work to the World Wide Web,
while the secondary is having fun and learning while building it ðŸ˜ƒ\
It's built with `Next` and is hosted on Vercel's amazing hosting service.
## What's under the hood?
I built this project based on my very own
[React Template project](/project/react-template "Go to React Template project details"),
which in turn is built with my very own [Babel Plugin](/project/babel-plugin "Go to Babel Plugin project details").\
Initially it was built with `CRA`, but I migrated id to `Next`.

- The 3D animation on the Landing page (only on desktop, on mobile you're served with a static image!) is created with [Spline](https://spline.design/ "Go to Spline home page").
- Scroll animations are done with `IntersectionObserver`.
- The text content for projects is written in `Markdown`.
